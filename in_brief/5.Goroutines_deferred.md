#### Goroutines

- Concurrent computing is a form of computing in which several computations are executed during overlapping time periods.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
	"time"
)

func worker(id int, wg *sync.WaitGroup) {

	defer wg.Done()

	fmt.Printf("Worker %d starting\n", id)

	time.Sleep(time.Second)
	fmt.Printf("Worker %d done\n", id)
}

func main() {

	var wg sync.WaitGroup

	for i := 1; i <= 5; i++ {
		wg.Add(1)
		go worker(i, &wg)
	}

	wg.Wait()
}
```

```bash
Worker 5 starting
Worker 1 starting
Worker 2 starting
Worker 3 starting
Worker 4 starting
Worker 4 done
Worker 1 done
Worker 5 done
Worker 2 done
Worker 3 done
```

#### defer function

- A deferred function is a function that gets called when the parent function returns and enters its exiting phase.
- One function can have multiple deferred functions.
- It gets called out as first in last out order.
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func f() {
	defer func() {
		fmt.Println("Defer called...4")
	}()

	defer func() {
		fmt.Println("Defer called...1")
	}()

	defer func() {
		fmt.Println("Defer called...2")
	}()

	defer func() {
		fmt.Println("Defer called...3")
	}()
}

func main() {
	f()
}
```

```bash
Defer called...3
Defer called...2
Defer called...1
Defer called...4
```


- defer function can change return value but it won't impact the return value recevied by other function, as it gets called after `return` statement

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func f() int {
	var x int = 10
	defer func() {
		fmt.Println("...")
		x += 10
		fmt.Println("x in defer: ", x)
	}()

	return x
}

func main() {
	x := f()
	fmt.Println("x: ", x)
}
```

```bash
...
x in defer:  20
x:  10

```
